                 <p class = "section">Hello! My name is Fernando Lopez Zamora. I am a new student taking the U of A Coding Boot Camp. This past week was my first experience with any type of coding, and I am very excited to learn a lot more. I was born in Tijuana B.C, Mexico and moved to the states when I was 4 years old. I have been living in Arizona all my life and I love it here. I attended Valley Vista High School and Graduated in 2017 and I never really knew what to do after. So I decided to try coding since my past job as a truck driver was too demanding and was making me stay away from home for too long. With that being said I a super excited to start a new career in coding!!!

                Below is an example and picture of the website and work that I have done to said website. I was told to work on this website and check for error and to make sure that everything was functioning properly. And I was able to get everything done with the expectations given to me were met.
